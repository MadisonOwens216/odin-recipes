    <h3> Description </h3>
    <p> This simple smoothie is so easy to make, and uses ingredients that you most lilkely already have in your fridge / pantry! 
        While I personally enjoy this smoothie as a post-workout pick-me-up, this would also be an awesome breakfast option or mid-day treat. 
        If you want to create a more complex flavor profile, consider adding in some dark chocolate or coffee to take this smoothie to the next level. </p>
