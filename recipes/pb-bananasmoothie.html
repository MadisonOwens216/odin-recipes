    <h3> Description </h3>
    <p> This simple smoothie is so easy to make, and uses ingredients that you most lilkely already have in your fridge / pantry! 
        While I personally enjoy this smoothie as a post-workout pick-me-up, this would also be an awesome breakfast option or mid-day treat. 
        If you want to create a more complex flavor profile, consider adding in some dark chocolate or coffee to take this smoothie to the next level. </p>
    <h3> Ingredients </h3>
    <ul>
        <li> 1.5 frozen banana (chopped) </li>
        <li> 1 cup almond milk </li>
        <li> 1.5 tablespoon peanut butter </li>
        <li> 1 teaspoon vanilla </li>
    </ul>

    <h3> Steps </h3>
    <ol> 
        <li> Place chopped frozen bananas, milk, peanut butter and vanilla into the blender </li>
        <li> Blend on pulse. If the smoothie is too thick and not blending properly, add more almond milk </li>
        <li> Pour into a glass and enjoy! </li>
    </ol>
